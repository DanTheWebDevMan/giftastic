/* Pseudocode BrainStorming:

**None of the buttons are written in the html file, but in the js instead**

Create an array of strings with a related topic
    - save this array as a variable called 'topics'
    - Have each index show up as a preloaded button on the page
If you click on a button, it'll give you 10 static gifs related to that button
    - if gif is clicked on, it becomes animated and stops when clicked again
    -every gif will have its rating underneath
If you search and submit, a new button with the searched word will appear as an option
Add a form to your page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your `topics` array. 
Make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page

var topics = ["batman", "superman", "iron man", "wonder woman", "hulk", "thor", "spider man", "captain america", "black panther", "dr. strange", "star lord", "groot", "flash", "aquaman", "antman", "black widow", "vision", "scarlet witch"]
